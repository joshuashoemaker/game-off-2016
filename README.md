#Mona's Escape
## GitHub Game Off 2016

![GitHub Game Off 2016 Theme is Hacking, Modding, or Augmenting](https://github.com/joshuashoemaker/game-off-2016/blob/master/GameCapture.jpg)

This is our first year participating in Github's Game Off. Typically we would have developed in Unity using C# but we decided to create
somehting will no tools and with javascript instead. It was quite a learning experience, both fun and frustrating.

Mona's Escape is a small demo where you play as the lovely octocat tryting to escape it's prizon in Area 51 Air Base. But first, Mona
needs to hack the terminals to find a way out. Also watch out for the guards. Are are just a lovable cat and octopus hybrid, so you
are not very equipt for combat.

Please enjoy, and so rry for any bugs, we only had a few ours to throw this together.

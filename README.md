#Mona's Escape
## GitHub Game Off 2016

![GitHub Game Off 2016 Theme is Hacking, Modding, or Augmenting](https://github.com/joshuashoemaker/game-off-2016/blob/master/GameCapture.JPG)

This is our first year participating in Github's Game Off. Typically we would have developed in Unity using C# but we decided to create
somehting with no tools and using javascript instead. It was quite a learning experience, both fun and frustrating.

Mona's Escape is a small demo where you play as the lovely octocat tryting to escape it's prizon in Area 51 Air Base. But first, Mona
needs to hack the terminals to find a way out. Also watch out for the guards. You are just a lovable cat and octopus hybrid, so you
are not very equipped for combat.

Please enjoy, and sorry for any bugs, we only had a few hours to throw this together.
  Primary Bug: The sound files can not be reached from HTTP request. No idea why since they do when gosting on a local server.

###To Play
Either clone the reposotory and host on a simple HTTP server or go to this address: https://joshuashoemaker.github.io/game-off-2016
You may experience less bugs if you play on your own server.
